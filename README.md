# ML_Capstone_Air_Pollution

**Business Problem Statement**

The dataset provided aims at facilitating a comprehensive analysis and the development of mitigation strategies for air pollution in the United States. With an increasing concern for environmental health and air quality, understanding pollution trends and their impacts across different regions of the country is crucial. This dataset focuses on key pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3) to aid in the formulation of targeted environmental policies and health advisories.

**Background**

Amidst growing environmental concerns, there is a pressing need for an in-depth analysis of pollution trends and their impacts across different regions of the United States. This dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of air quality in the U.S., spanning from the year 2000 to 2022. It includes data sourced primarily from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with additional contributions and enhancements by Kagglers BrendaSo and ANGELA KIM.

**Scope**

The dataset encompasses an extensive analysis of air quality in the United States, focusing on key pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3). It covers a period from the year 2000 to 2022 and offers insights into pollution levels across various states, counties, and cities.
